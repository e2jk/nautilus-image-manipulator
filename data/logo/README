Nautilus Image Manipulator's logo was created by modifying and mixing together 2 images from the Open Clip Art Library:

http://openclipart.org/detail/17373/photos-by-ytknick
http://openclipart.org/detail/26221/lightning-icon-by-anonymous

The source images can be found in the `source` folder, along with the project file used to generate the final logo.
