  * Added incomplete Russian translation (thanks Eugene Marshal)

================================
1.2 - 2013-02-18 (r199)
  * Fix uploading to 1fichier.com (LP #1100027)

================================
1.1 - 2012-04-30 (r187)
  * Better management of profiles. In particular, make sure that there are
      no profiles that have the same name.

================================
1.0 - 2012-04-17 (r165)
  * Major change: completely redesigned user interface. Now the parameters
      that determine how the images are to be resized are set via profiles.
      A set of default profiles is provided, but the user can freely add or
      remove profiles. The focus of this new UI is a very simplified and
      streamlined user experience. We try to limit the technical jargon to
      a minimum ;) (LP #936003)
  * Prevent Nautilus from freezing when Nautilus Image Manipulator is
      launched (LP #931762)
  * Move the config file to ~/.config/nautilus-image-manipulator/config
      (LP #935738)
  * Started writing "proper" documentation (LP #962443)
      see http://nautilus-image-manipulator.readthedocs.org/
  * Started writing unit tests with nose (LP #946610)

================================
0.8 - 2012-02-14 (r139)
  * Force .jpg extension on resized images filenames (LP #931975)

================================
0.7 - 2012-02-14 (r132)
  * N I M now depends on the pil and pyexiv2 packages, and not anymore on
      ImageMagick:
    - Use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) instead of ImageMagick to resize
        the images (merge branch from lp:~razerraz)
    - Update the image metadata (Exif) after resizing the images (merge
        branch from lp:~razerraz)
  * Take care of preserving aspect ratio (changeable via ui) (thanks again
      lp:~razerraz)
  * Handle an exception when reading preferences when the preferences file
      does not exist
  * Automate the updating of new translations

================================
0.6 - 2012-01-31 (r122)
  * Add custom compression level (merge branch from lp:~razerraz)
  * Take care of eventual exceptions if a value is not set when loading
      configuration from the ini file
  * Added Brazilian Portuguese translation (Thanks Renan)

================================
0.5 - 2011-11-22 (r113)
  * Make sure that only valid filenames are passed (LP #711508 and
      LP#711509)
  * Better handling of zipfile creation
  * Do not allow appendString to end in "/", because the image would be
      called ".EXT", which is a hidden file in it's own folder
  * Various lower-level enhancements
    - Gracefully handle when ImageMagick is not installed (LP #877738)
    - Display an error message is DistUtilsExtra is not installed when
        updating the translations
