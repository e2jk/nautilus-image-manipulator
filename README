Resize and send images from Nautilus


nautilus-image-manipulator is a Nautilus extension that lets you resize
images and send them to friends and family, right from Nautilus.

Just right-click on any photo or group of photos, and  an  option  will
appear that launches Nautilus Image Manipulator.

It is highly inspirated by Nautilus Image Converter:

You will need Python's Imaging module and (optionally) pyexiv2. On Debian
and derivatives, those packages can be installed with this command:
    sudo apt-get install python-imaging python-pyexiv2
