Resize and send images from Nautilus


nautilus-image-manipulator is a Nautilus extension that lets you resize
images and send them to friends and family, right from Nautilus.

Just right-click on any photo or group of photos, and an option will
appear that launches Nautilus Image Manipulator.

A set of default settings make it easy to quickly resize pictures. You
can also easily create your own profiles for later reuse.



You will need Python's Imaging module and (optionally) pyexiv2. On Debian
and derivatives, those packages can be installed with this command:
    sudo apt-get install python-imaging python-pyexiv2



It was originally highly inspirated by Nautilus Image Converter, but since
version 1.0 it has obtained a very different user interface.
