Nautilus Image Manipulator's documentation
==========================================

:Version: |version|

:Date: |today|

Nautilus Image Manipulator is a `Nautilus`_ extension that lets you resize
images and send them to friends and family, right from `GNOME`_'s default file
manager. Just right-click on any photo or group of photos, and an option will
appear that launches Nautilus Image Manipulator. A set of default settings make
it easy to quickly resize pictures. You can also easily create your own
profiles for later reuse.

This documentation contains information for end users, such as how to install
the program and run it, and also information that would be useful for
developers interested in expanding NIM's capabilities or packaging it for their
preferred Linux distribution.

This documentation is a work on progress, so stay tuned!
